## TODO

- [] start to work on Proximis cart which, shows different collection methods
  - [] re-organize cart files under `leav_storefront/live`
- [x] fix Proximis set to default in `integratios` page

## Happenings

During the tests on `staging` I was able to see that it was missing to configure
the integratios controller to accept `Proximis` as a default POS provider. To make
it work it was just nessary to add `proximis` to the pattern matching. I also added
a test case to proximis

The live `Cart` files are spread throughout the whole `live/`. I will try to organize it
under its folder in `live`.

## For tomorrow
